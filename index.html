        <h2>RUSSIA </h2>
        <p>
            Snowflakes are falling, falling into our hands
            And I feel so good with you and I have no time to be bored
            Salutes melt, fly and not a minute
            We will not lose, we will dance
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            A miracle will happen, let's have fun
            Na-na-na-na-na-na
            Miracle will happen, New Year is knocking
            The frost left you the drawings on the window
            Hurry, give me your hand, we'll play with you
            Ah ah ah! Catch up quickly
            Ah ah ah! Shoot snowballs at me
            And make a wish
            In the New Year (make a wish)
            Snowflakes are falling, falling into our hands
            And I feel so good with you and I have no time to be bored
            Salutes melt, fly and not a minute
            We will not lose, we will dance
        </p>
